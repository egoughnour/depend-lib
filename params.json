In a very general sense.\r\n\r\n## How it works\r\nRight now I'm contemplating a workflow something like this:\r\n### Preprocessing\r\n1. General preprocessing\r\n2. Per-file preprocessing\r\n Optional input file list  \r\n\r\n### Execution\r\n* a visitor pattern or perhaps \r\n* a method for dividing the source into addressable, referenceable or otherwise meaningfully separate parts \r\n\r\n\r\n## How to use\r\nPass in some indication of what you want out. Such as the smallest non-trivial eigenvector of your Laplacian matrix. Then you can do some agglomeration over the scalars that make up the vector. \r\n\r\n## Authors and Contributors\r\n@egoughnour so far.\r\n\r\n### License\r\n\r\nMIT.  \r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving troubles?
